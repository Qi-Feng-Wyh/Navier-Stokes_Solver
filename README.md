# Navier-Stokes_Solver
Final Homework for Numerical Algebra at Peking University

Numerical Solver for Navier-Stokes in Three Different Methods:
1. V-Cycle Method with DGS Iteration as polisher
2. Uzawa Method to get exact solution
3. Inexact Uzawa Method with PCG (pre-conditioned conjugate gradient), where preconditoner is V-Cycle Method with SGD(symmetry Gauss-Seidel) as polisher.
